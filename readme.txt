Mission: Cratesistance (adversarial, up to 94 players)
Version: 3
Developer(s): harakka, with kind help of Folk ARPS (http://www.folkarps.com) mission makers and players
Description: CDF seeks and destroys NAPA caches, NAPA defends caches and hunts down CDF.
A CDF squad is sent to find and destroy multiple lightly defended NAPA guerrilla weapons caches. However, NAPA has caught wind of the CDF operation, and a squad of guerrillas is ready to defend the caches and hunt down the corrupt government lackeys.

The caches are defended by a small number of AI NAPA guerrillas. The AI units will, if not eliminated quickly, mark any spotted CDF units on the map for guerrillas to see.

The mission is heavily randomized and won't play the same twice. Unfortunately due to the randomization scripts, cache markers and team start locations aren't visible during the briefing, they are only shown after the briefing is over and mission starts.

No addons are required to play the mission.
Made with version 2-7 of the F2 framework (http://www.ferstaberinde.com/f2/en/)
